# hello-world
Just another first repository

Hi,

My name is Kosta and I'm trying to remember how to code.

This markdown editor is nice. It feels like being back at school again, when I was learning programming and building my own HTML websites.

This was about 20 years ago, and feels like a lifetime ago! A lot has changed in coding, I'm sure.

Bye for now.
